ChatGPT was used to determine how to create a range of colors for the bubbles in the bubble chart. This code was implemented in the function createBubbleChart() in the app.js file.

Plotly.com was referenced when creating the gauge chart. (The needle is currently not working, so there is a number in it's place.)
